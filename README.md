# hw3
1. line(x, height-10, x + random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
2.  if (random() > 0.999) {
    noStroke();
    fill(255);
    rect(-1, -1, width+2, height-15);
    h = 10;
    The lawnmower comes randomly.
3. The h variable is responsible for the varying heights of the grass.
4. Hue, saturation, and brightness.
